# __The 'SEMS' project__
**where 'SEMS' is '_Scientific Elevators Modeling Software_'**  



## What is '**SEMS**'?

'**SEMS**' is a set of several packages that allows to build flexible models of passenger elevators and use them to test elevator control algorithms and compare their effectiveness.


  ### '__SEMS__' includes
    
  * __[`pylvtmod`](pylvtmod) package__ - elevators model & '**SEMS**' project core package
  * __[`pylvthelp`](pylvthelp) package__ - package, containing some helpers and pre-defined classes, called to make work with [`pylvtmod`](pylvtmod) and model setup process easier

  ### Also in the box

  * __[`clrscr`](clrscr) package__ - little (really little - only 1 simple function) package, provides `clrscr()` function to clear console
  * __[`research`](research) demo project__ - a little research project, implements some simplest lift alghorithms using [`pylvtmod`](pylvtmod) & [`pylvthelp`](pylvthelp)
  * __[`materials`](materials) folder__ - there you can find some additional materials about project
